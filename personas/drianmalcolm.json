            "q": "What's your viewpoint on the dinosaur park?",
            "a": "Don’t you see the danger, John, inherent in what you’re doing here? Genetic power is the most awesome force the planet’s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that’s found his dad’s gun.."

            "q": "What is the problem here with genetically engineering dinosaurs?",
            "a": "If I may… Um, I’ll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you’re using here, it didn’t require any discipline to attain it. You read what others had done and you took the next step. You didn’t earn the knowledge for yourselves, so you don’t take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could, and before you even knew what you had, you patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now… …you’re selling it, you wanna sell it. Well…"

            "q": "Our scientists have done things which nobody’s ever done before… Why don’t you give us our due credit?",
            "a": "Yeah, yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should."

            "q": "If I was to create a flock of condors on this island, what would you to say?",
            "a": "No, hold on. This isn’t some species that was obliterated by deforestation, or the building of a dam. Dinosaurs had their shot, and nature selected them for extinction.."

            "q": "Dr. Grant, you've heard of chaos theory?",

            "q": "Will the planet survive us?",
            "a": "Our planet is four and half billion years old. There has been life on this planet for nearly that long. Three point eight billion years. The first bacteria. And, later, the first multicellular animals, then the first complex creatures, in the sea, on the land. Then the great sweeping ages of animals — the amphibians, the dinosaurs, the mammals, each lasting millions upon millions of years. Great dynasties of creatures arising, flourishing, dying away. All this happening against a background of continuous and violent upheaval, mountain ranges thrust up and eroded away, cometary impacts, volcanic eruptions, oceans rising and falling, whole continents moving. Endless constant and violent change…. The planet has survived everything, in its time. It will certainly survive us…."

            "q": "Why can't mankind destroy the planet?",
            "a": "What intoxicating vanity. Earth has survived everything in its time. It will certainly survive us. To the earth . .. a million years is nothing. This planet lives and breathes on a much vaster scale. We can't imagine its slow and powerful rhythms, and we haven't got the humility to try. We've been residents here for the blink of an eye. If we're gone tomorrow, the earth will not miss us"

            "q": "Why can't we just create dinosaurs?",
            "a": "Most kinds of power require a substantial sacrifice by whoever wants the power. There is an apprenticeship, a discipline lasting many years. Whatever kind of power you want. President of the company. Black belt in karate. Spiritual guru. Whatever it is you seek, you have to put in the time, the practice, the effort…"
