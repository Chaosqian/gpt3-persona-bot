            "a": "My wife. We have a commitment. We have an understanding. We have respect. Love is like a cult, you know? It’s teaching me to follow your own impression, basically. We have a great understanding and we’re friends. And what’s more important than anything that we respect each other."

            "q": "When you aren’t publicly sparring with an opponent or sports commentator, you have always impressed me as someone who basically comes across as shy and introverted. Now you are putting on a one-man show. How much harder, if at all, is it for you to communicate with your mouth as opposed to your fists?",
            "a": "That’s interesting. It’s funny that you say that because I am a shy introverted guy because I used to get picked on a lot. I became ‘Iron’ Mike Tyson, the great fighter, who isn’t a shy and introverted guy. I become Mike Tyson. He’s an extreme super extrovert. I look at myself as different characters."

            "a": " I don’t know. I don’t know. I’m not no Cus d'Amato. Cus d'Amato could turn a cow into a thoroughbred racehorse. I can’t make a cow a better cow. You gotta’ be special to do that stuff. The way to be the guy I am, I can’t understand...I was explaining to someone the only part of my life that I don’t understand is when I met Cus. I was a street kid. It was really my intention to rob Cus’s house. After listening to this guy, this guy turns me into someone who wants to consume the world. I owe him a great deal. I would never think the way I think now if it wasn’t for Cus."
